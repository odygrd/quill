/**
 * Quill refers all formatting to the backend thread. That means that the objects get copied to
 * a queue and later on processed on the backend thread which calls operator<< to format them.
 *
 * In some cases when a user defined type has mutable references in the object this can be
 * problematic as they can be modified by the caller thread while they are trying to get
 * formatted on the backend logger thread.
 *
 * By default Quill checks in compile time if the object is safe to get copied. User defined
 * types can also provide a tag or an external template specialization :
 *
 * Tagging on your class :
 * 'using copy_loggable = std::true_type` -> This will indicate that the object is copyable.
 * 'using copy_loggable = std::false` or missing tag -> This will indicate that the object is NOT copyable.
 *
 * Preferred way, provide a specialization to copy_loggable without modifying your class :
 * namespace quill {
 * template <>
 * struct copy_loggable<UserDefinedType> : std::true_type { };
 * }
 *
 * If the user defined type has `shared` mutable references to other objects as class members
 * this should NOT be provided, instead the formatting should be done explicitly on the caller
 * thread side by the user.
 *
 * MODE_UNSAFE is not recommended as the user should be never careful when logging user
 * defined types.
 * When MODE_UNSAFE is enabled quill will no longer perform any checks and will copy any user
 * defined types that are copy constructible to the queue and will format those copies later at the
 * backend logging thread.
 * If you enable MODE_UNSAFE you no longer have to tag your classes or specialize copy_loggable.

 * When QUILL_USE_BOUNDED_QUEUE is defined a bounded queue for passing the log messages
 * to the backend thread, instead of the default unbounded queue is used.
 *
 * Bounded Queue : When full the log messages will get dropped.
 * Unbounded Queue : When full, a new queue is allocated and no log messages are lost.
 *
 * The default mode is unbounded queue as the recommended option. The overhead is low.
 * Using QUILL_USE_BOUNDED_QUEUE option is in the case when all re-allocations should be avoided.
 * In QUILL_USE_BOUNDED_QUEUE mode the number of dropped log messages is written to stderr.
 *
 * @note: In both modes (unbounded or bounded) the queue size is configurable via `quill::config::set_initial_queue_capacity`.
 *
 * @note: You can avoid re-allocations when using the unbounded queue (default mode) by setting the initial_queue_capacity to a higher value.
 * QUILL_USE_BOUNDED_QUEUE mode seems to be faster in `quill_hot_path_rdtsc_clock` benchmark by a few nanoseconds.
