/**
 * If QUILL_CHRONO_CLOCK value is defined, Quill will use chrono system_clock for timestamps.
 *
 * QUILL RDTSC CLOCK mode :
 *
 * TSC clock gives better performance on the caller thread. However, the initialisation time of the application is higher as
 * we have to take multiple samples in the beginning to convert TSC to nanoseconds
 *
 * Consider reading https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42189976/calculate-system-time-using-rdtsc
 *
 * The backend thread is constantly keeping track of the difference between TSC and the system wall clock resulting
 * in accurate timestamps.
 *
 * When using the TSC counter the backend thread will also periodically call chrono::system_clock:now() and will
 * resync the TSC based on the system clock.
 *
 * @note: This should be switchable even after quill is already installed as a static or shared library.
 *
 * Usage:
 * Run cmake as e.g: cmake . -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-DQUILL_CHRONO_CLOCK=1"
 * or
 * In the root CMake file use: `add_definitions(-DQUILL_CHRONO_CLOCK=1)`
 *
 * By default RDTSC clock is enabled

 * getting the system time from the system wall clock.
 * The TSC clock drifts slightly over time and is also not synchronised with the NTP server updates
 * Therefore the smaller this value is the more accurate the log timestamps will be.
 *
 * It is not recommended to change the default value unless there is a real reason.

/**
 * Quill refers all formatting to the backend thread. That means that the objects get copied to
 * a queue and later on processed on the backend thread which calls operator<< to format them.
 *
 * In some cases when a user defined type has mutable references in the object this can be
 * problematic as they can be modified by the caller thread while they are trying to get
 * formatted on the backend logger thread.
 *
 * By default Quill checks in compile time if the object is safe to get copied. User defined
 * types can also provide a tag :
 *
 * 'using copy_loggable = std::true_type` -> This will indicate that the object is copyable.
 * 'using copy_loggable = std::false` or missing tag -> This will indicate that the object is NOT copyable.
 *
 * There is a convenience macro also `QUILL_COPY_LOGGABLE`
 *
 * If the user defined type has shared mutable references to other objects as class members
 * this tag should not be provided, instead the formatting should be done explicitly on the caller
 * thread side by the user.
 *
 * QUILL_MODE_UNSAFE is not recommended as the user should be never careful when logging user
 * defined types.
 * When QUILL_MODE_UNSAFE is enabled quill will copy any user defined types that are copy constructible
 * to the queue.
 * Tag `copy_loggable` is no longer applicable in QUILL_MODE_UNSAFE
 *
 * QUILL_MODE_UNSAFE needs to be defined before including Quill.h
 *
 * Usage:
 * Run cmake as e.g: cmake . -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-DQUILL_MODE_UNSAFE"
 * or
 * In the root CMake file use: `add_definitions(-DQUILL_MODE_UNSAFE)`

/**
 * Quill uses a unbounded SPSC queue per spawned thread to forward the LogRecords to the backend thread.
 *
 * During very high logging activity the backend thread won't be able to consume fast enough
 * and the queue will become full. In this scenario the caller thread will not block but instead
 * it will allocate a new queue of the same capacity.
 *
 * If the backend thread is falling behind also consider reducing the sleep duration of the backend
 * thread first or pinning it to a dedicated core. This will keep the queue more empty.
 *
 * The queue size can be increased or decreased based on the user needs. This queue will be shared
 * between two threads and it should not exceed the size of LLC cache.
 *
 * @warning The configured queue size needs to be in bytes, it MUST be a power of two and a multiple
 * of the page size (4096).
 * Look for an online Mebibyte to Byte converted to easily find a correct value.

/**
 * When QUILL_USE_BOUNDED_QUEUE is defined a bounded queue for passing the log messages

 * Bounded Queue : When full the log messages will get dropped.
 * Unbounded Queue : When full, a new queue is allocated and no log messages are lost.
 *
 * The default mode is unbounded queue as the recommended option. The overhead is low.
 * Using QUILL_USE_BOUNDED_QUEUE option is in the case when all re-allocations should be avoided.
 * In QUILL_USE_BOUNDED_QUEUE mode the number of dropped log messages is written to stderr.
 *
 * @note: In both modes (unbounded or bounded) the queue size is configurable via `quill::config::set_initial_queue_capacity`.
 *
 * @note: You can avoid re-allocations when using the unbounded queue (default mode) by setting the initial_queue_capacity to a higher value.
 * QUILL_USE_BOUNDED_QUEUE mode seems to be faster in `quill_hot_path_rdtsc_clock` benchmark by a few nanoseconds.
