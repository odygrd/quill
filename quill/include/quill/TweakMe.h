/**
 * Quill defers formatting to the backend thread. Objects are copied to a queue and formatted
 * by the backend thread using operator<<.
 *
 * When a user-defined type has mutable references, this can be problematic if the object
 * is modified by the caller thread during formatting on the backend logger thread.
 *
 * By default, Quill checks at compile time if the object is safe to copy. User-defined types
 * can provide a tag or an external template specialization:
 *
 * 1) Tagging on your class:
 *
 *   'using copy_loggable = std::true_type` -> Indicates the object is copyable.
 *   'using copy_loggable = std::false` or missing tag -> Indicates the object is NOT copyable.
 *
 * 2) Preferred way: provide a specialization to copy_loggable without modifying your class:
 *
 *   namespace quill {
 *     template <>
 *     struct copy_loggable<UserDefinedType> : std::true_type { };
 *   }
 *
 * If the user-defined type has shared mutable references as class members, do not provide this.
 * Formatting should be done explicitly on the caller thread side by the user.
 *
 * MODE_UNSAFE is not recommended as it requires careful handling when logging user-defined types.
 * When MODE_UNSAFE is enabled, Quill copies any copy-constructible user-defined types to the queue
 * without checks. Tagging or specialization is not required.
