/**
 * @brief Base class that provides a timestamp for log statements based on a user-provided clock source.
 *
 * This base class can be derived from to pass a user-generated timestamp to a Logger.
 *
 * It is particularly useful for simulations or scenarios where time manipulation is necessary,
 * such as simulating time in the past and displaying past timestamps in logs.
 *
 * @note The derived class must be thread-safe if the Logger object is used across multiple threads.
 * If a Logger is used within a single thread only, thread safety is not a concern.
