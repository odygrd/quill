## v1.6.1

**Improvements/Fixes**

- Fix windows C++20 build. ([#83](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/83))
- Fix ARM build on windows.
- Fix `example_backtrace` and minor bug when destructing with empty backtrace.

## v1.6.0

**New Features**

- Dual queue mode offering even lower latencies on hot paths.
  See [Dual Queue Mode](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/wiki/9.-Dual-Queue-Mode).
- Added a signal handler for linux and windows. The signal handler flushes the log when the app crashes or
  exits. ([#1](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/1))
- Added support for custom handlers. ([#75](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/75))
- Quill now compiles and runs on Cygwin.

**Improvements/Fixes**

- The queue from the caller to the backend worker thread has been reworked. The new queue generates slightly better
  assembly than the previous one. Quill does no longer depend on mapping the same region of physical memory twice.
- Replaced an assertion check that could trigger incorrectly. ([#68](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/68))
- Fixed build on `ARM_ARCH < 6`. ([#78](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/78))
- Fixed compile errors when `QUILL_NOEXCEPTIONS`, `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20`, `QUILL_USE_BOUNDED_QUEUE` are set.
- The unit tests have been moved to a separate binary with their own `main()`. This increased build times when building the tests, but the failures are now easier to debug on different CI platforms and the tests can also run faster in parallel.
- Fixed minor compiler warnings on windows.
- Upgraded bundled libfmt to `7.1.3`

**Note**
- If a custom queue capacity is defined using `#define QUILL_QUEUE_CAPACITY` after `1.6.0` the whole library needs to be recompiled.

## v1.5.2
- Removed the use of `fmt::format()` in `FileUtilities.cpp` as a workaround to the link errors in fmt v7. Use the header only version of libfmt when external libfmt is defiend is no longer required.

## v1.5.1
- When QUILL_FMT_EXTERNAL is defined, `quill` will use the header only version of `libfmt`. This is a workaround to the link errors after libftm v7

## v1.5.0
- Upgraded bundled libfmt to `7.1.2`
- Added `Filters`. The filter class can be used for filtering log records. Filters can be added to handler instances. See [example_filters.cpp](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/example_filters.cpp)
- It is now possible to set the log level severity on the handler objects. See [example_filters.cpp](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/example_handler_log_levels.cpp) ([#49](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/49))
- Timestamp formatting optimisation for the backend worker thread.
- Free list allocator optimisation for the backend worker thread.
- Fixed PatternFormatter ignoring a portion of the pattern was ignored, when no format specifiers were present. ([#56](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/56))
- When `%(function_name)` is used in PatternFormatter the namespace delimiter is replaced from `::` to `.` (Windows only). ([#61](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/61))
- Arguments passed to the logger are no longer being evaluated when the log statement is not logged. ([#67](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/67))
- PatternFormatter enhancement. It is now possible to pass [{fmt} string syntax](https://fmt.dev/latest/syntax.html) to `QUILL_STRING`. The default PatternFormatter string has been changed to: `"%(ascii_time) [%(thread)] %(fileline:<28) LOG_%(level_name) %(logger_name:<12) - %(message)"`. This results to the following log being properly aligned despite the different lengths of each filename and logger name.
```
22:31:07.995438465 [2666041] file1.h:11                   LOG_INFO      logger1      - Log from file.
22:31:07.995445699 [2666041] long_file2.h:11              LOG_INFO      logger_fl2   - Log from other file.
22:31:07.995457144 [2666041] a_longer_file_3.hpp:11       LOG_INFO      logger_fl2_l - Log from other file.
22:31:07.995462471 [2666041] example_trivial.cpp:30       LOG_TRACE_L3  root         - This is a log trace l3 example 1
```

## v1.4.1
- Do not force `quill` to always build as `static` library in cmake.
- Minor fix when `quill` is compiled with no exceptions.
- Add the option to disable the non prefixed macro definitions if `QUILL_DISABLE_NON_PREFIXED_MACROS` is defined. ([#40](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/40)) 

## v1.4.0
- Added support for printing colour codes in the terminal. See [ConsoleHandler](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/wiki/2.-Handlers#consolehandler)
- RotatingFileHandler improvements and minor change in API. See [RotatingFileHandler](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/wiki/2.-Handlers#rotatingfilehandler)
- DailyFileHandler is removed and replaced by TimeRotatingFileHandler. See [TimeRotatingFileHandler](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/wiki/2.-Handlers#timerotatingfilehandler)
- Added backtrace logging. Log messages can be stored in a buffer and flushed later on demand. See [Backtrace Logging](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/wiki/6.-Backtrace-Logging)
- Added bundled `doctest` `2.4.0`
- Migrated all tests from `gtest` to `doctest`.
- Upgraded bundled libfmt to `7.0.3`

## v1.3.3
- Upgraded bundled libfmt to `7.0.2`
- Fixed compile error with libfmt versions > `7.0.0`

## v1.3.2
- Add a CMake option `QUILL_USE_BOUNDED_QUEUE` for bounded queue.
- Fixed a clang 10 warning
- Fixed MinGw build

## v1.3.1
- Minor CMake fixes when `QUILL_FMT_EXTERNAL` option is used.

## v1.3.0
**New Features**
- Added option `QUILL_NO_EXCEPTIONS` to disable exceptions, std::abort() is called instead of an exception. ([#16](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/16))
- Exceptions thrown in the backend worker thread, will now call a user provided error handler callback to handle the error. ([#21](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/21))
- Compile time checks for unsafe to copy user defined types. Non trivial user defined types must be explicitly tagged as safe to copy with the use of `QUILL_COPY_LOGGABLE;`. Otherwise they have to be formatted and passed as a string to the logger by the user. The old unsafe mode is still usable by `#define QUILL_MODE_UNSAFE` ([#20](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/20))
- Added `QUILL_USE_BOUNDED_QUEUE`. In this mode no new queues get allocated but instead log messages get lost. Number of lost messages is reported to stderr.
- Minor hot path optimisation. The pointer to the metadata for each log message is no logger copied to the queue but passed as a template argument instead.
- Added a latency benchmark, easily extendable for any logger

**Improvements/Fixes**
- `QUILL_RDTSC_CLOCK` option is replaced by `QUILL_CHRONO_CLOCK` which is by OFF by default.
- Improve compiler error message when trying to log a non copy constructible user defined type
- Fix buffer reallocation bug on TimestampFormatter. In previous versions any timestamp format set to 'set_pattern' expanding to a string longer than 32 bytes would cause a crash. ([#24](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/24))
- The backend logging thread will now copy all messages from the SPSC queue to a local priority queue. This keeps the SPSC less empty avoiding a potential allocation on the hot path.
- `std::string_view` is now promoted to `std::string` to take a deep copy
- The queue capacity has been moved from `config` to `Tweakme.h`.
- Multiple formats patterns support for `stdout` and `stderr` handlers. See [example_stdout_multiple_formatters.cpp](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/example_custom_formatter.cpp)
- `quill::start()` will now block until the backend worker has started.
- Upgraded bundled libfmt to `6.2.1`

## v1.2.3
- CMake changes to support package installation in conan.

## v1.2.2
- Support for `arm/arm64`. ([#19](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/19))
- Add a cmake option `QUILL_ENABLE_INSTALL` to enable cpack.

## v1.2.1
- Improved `QUILL_RDTSC_CLOCK` tweak option. It is now possible to switch between using `rdtsc` or `std::chrono` clock without having to recompile quill as library.

## v1.2.0
- Linking and including an external version of `fmt` is now supported. See `TweakMe.h`
- Fixed compiler warnings when using clang's `-Wdocumentation`. ([#12](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/12))
- Fixed a bug that wouldn't report a compile-time error for invalid format strings. ([#13](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/13))
- Added process ID to Formatter. ([#14](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/14))
- Enhanced timestamp formatting. The `timestamp_format` string passed in `handler->set_pattern(format_pattern, timestamp_format, timezone)` now accepts three additional specifiers `%Qms`, `%Qus`, `%Qus` that can be used to format the fractional seconds. See [here](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/wiki/3.-Formatters). ([#15](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/15))

## v1.1.0
- Daily file handler. The file handler rollover every 24 hours
- Rotating file handler. The file handler will rollover based on the size of the file
- MinGW compatibility
- Added a CMake option `QUILL_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE`. Building Quill as a master project now defaults to non verbose makefile output unless `-DQUILL_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON` is passed to CMake. ([#6](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/6))
- Flush policy improvement. Previously Quill backend worker thread would never `flush`. This made watching the live log of the application harder because the user has to wait for the operating system to flush or `quill::flush()` had to be called on the caller threads. This has now been fixed, when the backend thread worker has no more log messages to process it will automatically `flush`. ([#8](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/8))
- The log level names have been changed from `"LOG_INFO"`, `"LOG_DEBUG"`, etc to `"INFO"`, `"DEBUG"`, etc .. The default formatter string is now using `"LOG_"%(level_name)` instead of `%(level_name)` therefore there is now change in the behaviour. This change gives a lot of more flexibility to users who prefer to see e.g. `INFO` instead of `LOG_INFO` in the logs. ([#7](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/7))
- An option has been added to append the date to the filename when using a FileHandler `quill::file_handler(filename, mode, FilenameAppend);`. ([#7](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/7))
- It is now possible to specify the timezone of each handler timestamp. A new parameter is added to `file_handler->set_pattern(...)`. See `PatternFormatter::Timezone`. ([#7](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/7))
- Rename `emit` as it can conflict with Qt macros. ([#4](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/4))
- Upgraded `libfmt` to `6.2.0`.

## v1.0.0
- Initial release.
- Using `libfmt` to `6.1.2`.
