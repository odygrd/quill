/**
 * @brief Example of building Quill as a shared library.
 *
 * To build Quill as a shared library on Windows, follow these steps:
 * - Ensure the `QUILL_DLL_EXPORT` and `QUILL_DLL_IMPORT` flags are set as required
 * - You also need to set the CMake option: `-DCMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS=TRUE`
 *
 * Note:
 * On Windows, when using Quill inside a DLL that is dynamically loaded with `LoadLibrary` and then
 * freed with `FreeLibrary` at runtime, it's important to call `flush_log()` in DllMain during
 * `DLL_PROCESS_DETACH` in each DLL that is being unloaded.
 *
 * This ensures that no pending logs remain in the DLL being freed.
 *
 * BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE hModule, DWORD ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved)
 * {
 *   switch (ul_reason_for_call)
 *   {
 *   case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
 *     // Code to run when the DLL is loaded
 *     break;
 *   case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
 *   case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
 *     // Code to run when a thread is created or destroyed
 *     break;
 *   case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
 *     // Ensure any pending logs are flushed before the DLL is unloaded
 *     global_logger_a->flush_log();
 *     break;
 *   }
 *   return TRUE; // Successfully processed
 * }
